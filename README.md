## Description 
This is a TypeScript practice so that I am able to take advantages of TypeScript benefits in order to figure out error in ts file before compiling into JS file


## Do it by yourself 
- git clone https://github.com/johnhongannguyen/portfolio-official.git
- install Node js 
- install TypeScript ( npm install -g typescript)
- run tsc (compile into JS file and fix error if applicable)
- run node index.js
